Balena.io is a tool built to run large fleets of devices running (docker) containers in an easy way.
However for us as makers it offers great possibilities to stably run and control single devices running a single instance.

What this allows us is to run a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi (or any other SBC), managed by Balena.
Balena provides the host OS, a way to remotely log in, restart, and update the container after a push to Github.
Balena has a free account for up to 10 devices (which is probably more than enough for any hacker.


During this workshop, we will be making a Balena account (one per person), and experiment with installing / updating the containers we want.

We will have a limited number of Raspberry Pi's available to play with during the workshop (however ideally people would bring their own).
